					<p>You are probably here because either your boiler is broken, or it&rsquo;s worn out? Right? You must be considering a replacement. However, we are here to make the decision easier for you as you might be having a hard time deciding from the different types of boilers available, in Glasgow.</p>
					<p>One of the most known boilers is the combi boiler. Its compact size makes it a popular choice, as its alternatives like regular boilers are bigger in size. The easy-to-handle size of the combi boiler makes it easier to install as well. They also prove to be more effective than others.</p>
					<p>The million-dollar question is, is a combi boiler the right option for your house in Glasgow? We have compiled a few factors that require your consideration before you make this decision.</p>
					<ul class="bulletic">
					<li><strong>Size of the property</strong></li>
					</ul>
					<p>It&rsquo;s understandable that if you have a larger house, with multiple bathrooms, combi boilers can be a bit problematic. You will be unable to use multiple outlets simultaneously. For instance, you won&rsquo;t be able to run two showers at a time with a combi boiler.</p>
					<p>On the contrary, combi boilers are perfect if you have a small property with only a few people living in it.</p>
					<ul class="bulletic">
					<li><strong>Type of shower</strong></li>
					</ul>
					<p>Combi boiler will be incompatible if you have a power shower on your property. Since the water pressure is dependent on the pressure level you have at the water mains, it&rsquo;s not possible to have both, a combi boiler, and a power shower.</p>
					<ul class="bulletic">
					<li><strong>Strength of the main&rsquo;s pressure</strong></li>
					</ul>
					<p>It is important that you make sure the pressure at the water main is strong enough to handle water to the boiler. The pressure should be enough to carry out other functions too, that require a water supply, including using a washing machine, and flushing a toilet.</p>
					<p>If your house has low strength main pressure, a combi boiler might not be the best choice due to the incompatibility. You should be aware of this before you proceed with your boiler installation in Glasgow.</p>
					<ul class="bulletic">
					<li><strong>Pipework age</strong></li>
					</ul>
					<p>Do you live in an old property? Probably an ancestral home? While the property must be of great value, the original pipework will probably not support combi boilers. It might not be strong enough to handle the high-water pressure that comes with a combi boiler.</p>
					<h2><strong><em>Alternate Boiler Installations</em></strong><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></h2>
					<p>If you have a larger property, and want to run multiple water outlets at the same time, you might want to choose a system boiler. It is compact, just like the combi boiler, but it does need an external cylinder.</p>
					<p>Another option is regular boilers. You must need a storage tank, and a hot water cylinder, so if you&rsquo;ve got a smaller property, regular boiler might not be your choice for your replacement boiler glasgow.</p>
					<p>A less common option is electric boilers. These are quieter, (say bye-bye to noisy boilers), and also take less space. However, they are less efficient, which is a bummer.</p>
